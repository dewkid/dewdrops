TODO:

BUG - Login or out on view page will re-render the comment list to what it was when you first came to the page (before adding comments)
	
BUG - If logged in and click home, login then logout, get an error: - only happens with reduxImmutableStateInvariant
	browser.js:38 Uncaught Invariant Violation: A state mutation was detected between dispatches, in the path `users.0`.
	This may cause incorrect behavior. (http://redux.js.org/docs/Troubleshooting.html#never-mutate-reducer-arguments)
	


PROBLEM:
Couldn't get connect(mapStateToProps) to work.  A breakpoint in mapStateToProps was never being hit!
This is becase my router was sending the browser to the exported function component, INSTEAD of the default export connect!
Once I fixed the reference in the router, it started working correctly!
